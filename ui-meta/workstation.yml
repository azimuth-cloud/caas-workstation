  This workstation can be accessed using a web browser via the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}).

  The data volume is mounted at `/data`, and content stored there will persist for the lifetime
  of the workstation. Other parts of the filesystem may be affected during a patch operation,
  including any packages that have been installed using `apt`.

  Monitoring dashboards for the workstation are available using the [Monitoring service]({{ monitoring.url }}).

  Documentation on Workstation features such as EESSI and Podman can be found [here](https://stackhpc.github.io/azimuth-user-docs/platforms/linux-workstation/).
