usage_template: |-
  {% set webconsole = cluster | service("webconsole") %}
  {% set monitoring = cluster | service("monitoring") %}
  This workstation can be accessed using a web browser via the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}) or by SSH.

  The SSH key of the user that deployed the workstation is injected into the `azimuth` user:

  ```
  $ ssh azimuth@{{ cluster.outputs.cluster_access_ip | default("[cluster ip]") }}
  azimuth@{{ cluster.name }}-workstation:~$
  ```

  The home directory for the platform user - `/home/azimuth` - persists for the lifetime of the
  platform. **Content stored in this directory will be lost when the platform is deleted, but will
  be retained during a patch operation**. All system-level changes outside of this directory will
  be lost on a patch, including any packages installed using `apt`.

  If configured by your Azimuth administrator, a project filesystem may be mounted at `/project`.
  This filesystem is shared between all platforms deployed in the tenancy with `/project` directory
  support - see the individual platform documentation. **Content stored in this directory will be
  available to all such platforms, and is retained even when a platform is deleted.*

  Monitoring dashboards for the workstation are available using the [Monitoring service]({{ monitoring.url }}).

  Documentation on Workstation features such as EESSI and Podman can be found [here](https://azimuth-cloud.github.io/azimuth-user-docs/platforms/linux-workstation/).
