usage_template: |-
  {% set webconsole = cluster | service("webconsole") %}
  {% set monitoring = cluster | service("monitoring") %}
  This workstation can be accessed using a web browser via the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}) or by SSH.

  The SSH key of the user that deployed the workstation is injected into the `azimuth` user:

  ```
  $ ssh azimuth@{{ cluster.outputs.cluster_access_ip | default("[cluster ip]") }}
  azimuth@{{ cluster.name }}-workstation:~$
  ```

  The data volume is mounted at `/data`, and content stored there will persist for the lifetime
  of the workstation.

  If configured by the adminstrator, a project filesystem may be mounted at `/project`.
  Content stored there will be available to all such configured workstations and Slurm
  clusters, and will persist after deletion of workstations/clusters.

  Other parts of the filesystem may be affected during a patch operation,
  including any packages that have been installed using `apt`.

  Monitoring dashboards for the workstation are available using the [Monitoring service]({{ monitoring.url }}).

  Documentation on Workstation features such as EESSI and Podman can be found [here](https://azimuth-cloud.github.io/azimuth-user-docs/platforms/linux-workstation/).
